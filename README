Scraper does the scraping, and collates a deposit record
Scraper puts deposit record in local queue

Update service scans queue and for each changed record
Scraper contacts api webapp, authenticates and then deposits the record



API App
Gets incoming record and canonicalizes it
Puts canonicalised record into elasitcsearch index, no real need to store canonicalised record
